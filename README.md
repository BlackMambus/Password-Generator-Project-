# Password-Generator-Project-

Password generator project in Python is designed to create secure, randomized passwords to enhance online security. 
Using libraries like random and string, the script generates passwords by combining uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Users can specify the length of the password and optionally exclude certain character types to meet specific security requirements.
This project helps in ensuring strong password security, reducing vulnerabilities to cyber threats.
